        <p>My name is Pedro Chamorro, I am a new student at Eugene, Bushnell University. I come from an archipelago in Spain, Europe, located in the west of Africa. Because is a small island, the culture is the same for everyone, So many people have the same ambition that I have related to clothes. I would like to make a website related to clothing, for people can see the type of clothes I like and if they are interested in buying them, which is one of my hobbies in life, which is looking at clothes and collecting them. </p>
